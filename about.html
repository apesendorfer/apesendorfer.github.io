        <h3 id="info">How to use Finesse</h3>
          <div>Ever been frustrated Googling synonyms? 
          Here's your solution. Finesse helps you find the perfect word. Instead of giving rigid, imprecise suggestions like a thesaurus might, Finesse 
        relies on a dataset of the best writers around to give you creative, powerful synonyms. We found the words that make these writers unique, then used machine
        learning to connect them to your text input. Not every connection is an exact synonym: that's what makes finesse brilliant. You'll get ideas, too.</div>
        <ol>
      <li>Type in anything (though you'll get the fastest results with a paragraph or less). </li>
      <li>Finesse it. Usually a pretty fast process unless you're the first user in a long time. Never more than 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Mouse over a word to see suggestions!</li>
    <li>Either click on the suggestion or a number on your keyboard, 1-5, to change the word.</li>
            <li>Hit "Change" to push the changes to the text.</li>
    </ol>
        <div>Here are some fun examples: </div>
        <ul>
          <li>This sentence is very vague.</li>
          <li>After spending years developing an understanding of the nature of yearning, the narrator finds a fluid, quiet peace.</li>
          <li>Awesome sauce!</li>
        </ul>
          <h3>What's Next?</h3>
          <div>Finesse is a foundation. We want changing words to change the world: not just finding synonyms, but being more conscious of how we use write. 
        Racial and gender biases are rooted in language. Tools like Finesse can detect those biases by making their own connections between words. 
        We hope to empower that research process by proving its feasibility and practicality. Thanks for being a part of step 1, and stay tuned for what's next.</div>
